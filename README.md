# Dumplins
Our Names are Atoosa, Linda, and Libby and we are from Madison Academic Magnet High School.
I worked on the home page, a little bit of the dessert page, a little bit of the daily specials page, i also did all the waves. -Atoosa
I created the menu page, the daily special page, and worked on some of the dessert and reservation and dellivery page. Some challenges that are team faced were
problems with the footer and navbar. However, one accomplishment that that our team was proud of was adding a logo on the tab page. Throughout this project, I 
learned many different things about coding and am proud of our finished project. -Libby
I created the footer with the Atoosa creating the map, I had worked on daily specials page and reservation delivery; a bit of each page. I added the font to all the pages and navbar. -Linda
